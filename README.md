## About üéØ

Be a citizen attentive to the problems of everyday life. Efficiently and quickly notify and report issues you encounter in your community. Install the ``Ativo e Operante`` app!

The system consists of an Android App and a Web System capable of offering a tool to citizens who want to notify or report to the competent bodies about problems in the city, such as potholes in the street, abandonment of animals, pruning or cutting of trees, traffic problems, in short, any setback that can affect the daily life of the citizen.

The Android App allows access to authenticated people and thus provides the complaint module, in which the user will be able to register a complaint informing a title, a description, the level of urgency, the competent body and the type of problem. After filling in the complaint, it is sent to the Web System and received by an API Rest.

The Web System was developed in Spring Boot and in addition to the services (APIs) to interact with the app, it offers a module for the person responsible for the system to register the responsible bodies and the types of problems, in addition to having an interface that allows to list and view all reports, with options to delete and change them.
